  Servicing a vehicle can be dangerous. If you have not received service-related 
  training, the risks of injury, property damage, and failure of servicing 
  increase. The recommended servicing procedures for the vehicle in this 
  workshop manual were developed with Mazda-trained technicians in mind. This 
  manual may be useful to non-Mazda trained technicians, but a technician with 
  our service-related training and experience will be at less risk when 
  performing service operations. However, all users of this manual are expected 
  to at least know general safety procedures.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  This manual contains &quot;Warnings&quot; and &quot;Cautions&quot; applicable to risks not 
  normally encountered in a general technician&#39;s experience. They should be 
  followed to reduce the risk of injury and the risk that improper service or 
  repair may damage the vehicle or render it unsafe. It is also important to 
  understand that the &quot;Warnings&quot; and &quot;Cautions&quot; are not exhaustive. It is 
  impossible to warn of all the hazardous consequences that might result from 
  failure to follow the procedures.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The procedures 
  recommended and described in this manual are effective methods of performing 
  service and repair. Some require tools specifically designed for a specific 
  purpose. Persons using procedures and tools which are not recommended by Mazda 
  Motor Corporation must satisfy themselves thoroughly that neither personal 
  safety nor safety of the vehicle will be jeopardized.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The contents of this 
  manual, including drawings and specifications, are the latest available at the 
  time of printing, and Mazda Motor Corporation reserves the right to change the 
  vehicle designs and alter the contents of this manual without notice and 
  without incurring obligation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Parts should be replaced 
  with genuine Mazda replacement parts or with parts which match the quality of 
  genuine Mazda replacement parts. Persons using replacement parts of lesser 
  quality than that of genuine Mazda replacement parts must satisfy themselves 
  thoroughly that neither personal safety nor safety of the vehicle will be 
  jeopardized.</font></p>

  <font color="#FF0000">Mazda Motor Corporation is not responsible for any 
  problems which may arise from the use of this manual. The cause of such 
  problems includes but is not limited to insufficient service-related training, 
  use of improper tools, use of replacement parts of lesser quality than that of 
  genuine Mazda replacement parts, or not being aware of any revision of this 
  manual.<br>
